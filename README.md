## SVM - Support Vector Machine
 
Used for classification and regression analysis. 
SVM can be used for 2D and 3D planes. 

### How it works : 
- identify the right hyper-plane
- select the hyperplane which segregates the classes better 
- the margins have to be as large as possible
- the support vector are the most useful data points because they are the ones most likely to be incorrectly classified.

#### Terminology : 

**Support Vector Points** = the points closest to the hyperplane

**Margins** = the distance of the vectors from the hyperplane

**Hyperplane** = margin maximising line/separator
